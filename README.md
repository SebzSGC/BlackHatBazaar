🕹️ Retro React Native Project 🎮
Welcome to your Retro React Native project, where nostalgia meets cutting-edge technology! 🚀 This project was kickstarted using the awesome @react-native-community/cli, and now it's ready for you to bring it to life with a blast from the past. 🌟

💾 Getting Started
Pro Tip: Before you dive into the code, make sure you've completed the React Native - Environment Setup like a true 80s hacker! 🕹️

Step 1: Fire Up the Metro Server 🚇
Before you can start your time-traveling adventure, you need to power up Metro—the supercharged JavaScript bundler that drives React Native.

bash
Copiar código

# using npm (recommended by the cool kids 😎)

npm start

# OR using Yarn (for the rebels out there 🤘)

yarn start
Step 2: Boot Up Your App 🚀
Let Metro Bundler do its thing in a dedicated terminal. Now, open a new terminal window (because multitasking is cool) and launch your app:

On Android 👾
bash
Copiar código

# using npm

npm run android

# OR using Yarn

yarn android
On iOS 🍏
bash
Copiar código

# using npm

npm run ios

# OR using Yarn

yarn ios
⚡ If everything is set up correctly, your retro-themed app should be running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator in no time. Just like a cartridge game in a well-oiled console. 🕹️

Step 3: Hack the Mainframe... I Mean, Modify Your App! 💻
Now that you've got your app running, it's time to make it yours. Customize, tweak, and unleash your creativity!

Open App.tsx in your favorite text editor (maybe even a terminal-based one for maximum retro vibes). 🖥️

For Android: Double-tap <kbd>R</kbd> or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes in action!

For iOS: Just hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator and feel the power of your code changes instantly! ⚡

🎉 Congrats, Code Master! 🎉
You've just successfully run and customized your Retro React Native app. Time to take a victory lap... or maybe add some more cool features. 😉
